            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
              <span>their own section.</span> Continue reading for an
              introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and
              more!

            <h1>core components</h1>
            <p>
              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:
              <span>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn
              more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
              components work in React Native.

            <h1>react fundamentals</h1>
            <p>
              React Native runs on <span class="under">React</span>, a popular
              open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
              To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React
              itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
              refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p>
              <span class="text1">
                The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a
                cafe to work in.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text2">
                React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                elements inside JavaScript like so:
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text3">
                The React docs have
                <span class="under">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
                refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                <span class="color">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding
                it with curly braces inside
              </span>
            </p>
            <p><span class="text4"> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </span></p>
            <p>
              <span class="text5">
                While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data
                storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
                components memory!
              </span>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="section_4">
            <h1>handling text input</h1>
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <span>onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to
              be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
              that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
